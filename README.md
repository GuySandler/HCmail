# HCmail Client

Since this is where people will get Summer Of Making tracking from now on, I made this.

A modern HackClub Mail Client made with SvelteKit with an improved user experience.

## Features

- 📧 **Privacy** - All data stored locally in your browser
- 📱 **Vertical Mail Viewer** - Clean mail list
- 🎨 **Modern Styling** - Not Windows 98 and fits your page
- 🔍 **Mail Details** - Tracking information, dates, status, and "days ago counter"
- 🔗 **Quick Actions** - Copy public URLs, open tracking links

## Run it yourself:

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to the port with localhost::port or 127.0.0.1:port

### Setup

1. GO to the Settings page
2. Enter your Hack Club Mail API key (mail.hackclub.com)
3. Your key will be saved locally for future use
